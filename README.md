# MemoryCardGame
This project is a memory card game developed using the Java Swing library. The game consists of three different levels, each with increasing difficulty and unique mechanics.

Level 1: A beginner-friendly level that provides a basic memory-matching experience. The player has a limited number of card flips and must match all pairs within this limit.
Level 2: The number of cards increases, making the game more challenging. The player still has a limited number of flips, and incorrect matches cause the cards to remain visible for a short time before flipping back.
Level 3: The hardest level with a unique mechanic. Every incorrect match triggers an automatic shuffle of all cards. This feature is implemented using Java's Thread system to create a dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience. The player still has a fixed number of flips to complete the level.
The objective is to match all the cards without exceeding the given flip limit in each level. The game is built using Java's Swing library and multithreading (Thread) management to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.
